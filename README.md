# Tower of Terror

_Your mouth is dry, your legs are shaking and your heart is thumping - you've entered the Tower of Terror..._

_Press G to move through the rooms. Agh!! there's a skeleton, then a ghost, then a headless axeman! With each fresh shock your pulse rate rockets._

_Will you go on (G) or retreat (R) to recover a little? Watch the time - you've only got until midnight to reach the top of the Tower and the coveted Treasure. Watch your pulse rate too. Madness takes over when it reaches 150 and nothing can stop you leaping to your doom out of the window._


## About

This game is taken from Usborne games listing _Weird Computer Games_, which can be found [here](https://usborne.com/gb/books/computer-and-coding-books) along with several more computer books from the 1980s.

The original BASIC code has been directly translated to Python, and variables have been given new descriptive names.
